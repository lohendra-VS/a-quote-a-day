quote: It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.
author: Epictetus
what_it_means_to_me: This quote teaches me that I cannot control every situation in life, but I can control my reaction. It also reminds me to maintain patience, because patience helps me respond calmly and wisely instead of reacting emotionally.
