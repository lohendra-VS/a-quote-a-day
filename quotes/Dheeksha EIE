quote: “*Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to the error that counts.*”

author: — *NIKKI GIOVANNI*

what_it_means_to_me: The quote means that everyone makes mistakes, and it's not the mistake itself that's important, but how you respond to it. Instead of dwelling on the mistake or beating yourself up over it, focus on what you can do to fix it, learn from it, and move forward. It's all about taking responsibility and growing from the experience 💡.
