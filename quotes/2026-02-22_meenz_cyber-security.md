quote: I don’t believe in psychology. I believe in good moves.
author: Bobby Fischer
what_it_means_to_me: To me, this quote means I don’t waste time playing mind games. I let my moves do the talking. If my chess is strong, I don’t need psychology I need precision.
Winning isn’t about drama. It’s about delivering better moves on the board.
